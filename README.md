# Hi, I'm Michael 👋🏽 🚀

I am an Aerospace Engineer with a heavy interest in Software, particularly in DevSecOps and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning!

I'm an AE by formal education, which means a strong understanding in Matlab that transferred over to learning Python through its Matlab-mirroring libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Since learning Python, I've developed to a strong understanding of the language from its interpreter to various libraries for web development (Flask, Dash, requests, etc), the database layer (SQLAlchemy), and AI/ML (scikitlearn).

I've got a strong foundation in Java which also will extend to my ability to pick up other languages like C++, Perl, and more as needed.

Checkout some of my projects on this page and shoot me an email at mikilade@proton.me if you'd like to connect or chat about anything!
